# Ghost Image

Turn your image into 1x1px DIV element. You see it on screen but can't grab it like an image, literally Ghost.

## How does this work ?
App use HTML5 Canvas to get color data from an image. The data collected is then transformed into chain of CSS box-shadow to create "ghost image" of 1x1px DIV element.
